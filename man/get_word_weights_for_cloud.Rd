\title{Get Word Weights for Topic Word Cloud}
\usage{
get_word_weights_for_cloud(nmf_result, topic_index, n_top_words = 15)
}
\arguments{
\item{nmf_result}{An object of class `NMF`.}

\item{topic_index}{The index (1-based) of the topic to extract weights for.}

\item{n_top_words}{The number of top words/weights to return.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector where names are the top words and values are
  their scaled weights (sqrt(score)). Returns NULL if topic_index is invalid
  or no valid weights are found.
}
\description{
Extracts the top N words and their corresponding weights (scores) from the
basis matrix for a specific topic. Applies square root scaling to weights
similar to the original Python implementation for word cloud frequency scaling.
