\title{Create TF-IDF Matrix}
\usage{
create_tfidf_matrix(text_vector, control = list(weighting = tm::weightTfIdf))
}
\arguments{
\item{text_vector}{A character vector where each element represents a document.}

\item{control}{A list of control parameters passed to `tm::DocumentTermMatrix`.
Defaults include TF-IDF weighting. See `?TermDocumentMatrix` for options
(e.g., `list(weighting = weightTfIdf, bounds = list(global = c(5, Inf)))`).}
}
\value{
A sparse TermDocumentMatrix (dgTMatrix) with TF-IDF weights.
  Terms are rows, documents are columns.
}
\description{
Creates a Term-Document Matrix (TDM) with TF-IDF weighting from a vector of
cleaned text documents. Assumes input text is already processed (lowercase,
punctuation removed, stopwords removed, etc.). The final matrix has terms as rows
and documents as columns, as typically expected by the NMF package.
